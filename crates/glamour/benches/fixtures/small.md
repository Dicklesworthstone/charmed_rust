# Small Fixture

This is a small markdown fixture for glamour benchmarks. It includes a few
basic elements to exercise rendering.

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

Inline code looks like `let x = 1;` and **bold** or *italic* text should render.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("hello");
}
```

> A short blockquote for testing.
