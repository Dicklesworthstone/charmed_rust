# Glamour Documentation

This folder collects additional guides that go deeper than the crate-level README.
The content is organized by feature so it can be included in rustdoc and linked
from the public API docs.

## Table Rendering

- `tables/README.md` - Table rendering overview and quick start
- `tables/alignment.md` - Column alignment rules and examples
- `tables/borders.md` - Border styles and separators
- `tables/headers.md` - Header styling and text transforms
- `tables/themes.md` - Styling patterns and theme guidance
- `tables/unicode.md` - Unicode width handling and truncation

## Compatibility Notes

- `DISCREPANCIES.md` - Differences vs. the Go glamour behavior
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documentation change log (doc-only changes)
